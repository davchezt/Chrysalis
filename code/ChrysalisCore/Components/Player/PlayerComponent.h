/**
Provides functionality for a bare bones player entity. For Chrysalis we envision the player as an entity that represents the person
at the keyboard playing the game. The entity is responsible for gathering player input, overall camera management, and attaching to
character entities. It should be fairly lightweight and instead delegate the work out to other components.

In places where CRYENGINE makes implicit assumptions about the player class also being the character in play, we will proxy as best
as possible to the character class.

At present, entering game mode without being attached to an existing character entity will likely crash or cause unwanted effects.
